Welcome to my academic website! I am a mechanical engineer with a passion for fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermodynamics. I earned my BSc and MSc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, followed by a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas.

Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on computational fluid mechanics and its application in wind energy. My research endeavors have led me to explore innovative approaches to optimize wind farm performance, with a particular emphasis on the utilization of machine learning models for control co-design.

Currently, I am contributing to the field as a postdoctoral associate at Stony Brook University, where I continue to delve into the intersection of fluid mechanics, renewable energy, and artificial intelligence.

Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to explore further to learn more about my work and interests.
