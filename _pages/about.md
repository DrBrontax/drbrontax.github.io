Welcome to my website. I am Christian Santoni, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.

I received my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas.

My research lies at the intersection of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), heat transfer, and data-driven modeling for complex energy systems. I develop high-fidelity numerical simulations and physics-informed machine learning models to study fluid–thermal interactions, multiphysics coupling, and advanced control strategies. While much of my prior work has focused on wind turbine and wind farm aerodynamics, my broader research agenda centers on predictive modeling and control co-design for next-generation energy technologies.

At NC A&T, I lead research efforts in computational modeling and teach courses in fluid mechanics and thermal sciences. My goal is to advance robust, physics-based tools that support the safe, efficient, and resilient operation of modern energy systems.

Thank you for visiting.
